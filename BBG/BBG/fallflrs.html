    <div class="sedumname">Sedum sieboldii (October daphne):</div>
    <div class="Seduminfo">
    Often described as having the most beautiful foliage and form of all sedums, this adorable little plant looks great all summer long and then really comes into its own in fall. Sedum sieboldii is a low, spreading species that forms a rounded mound, sending out horizontal branches from the central crown. The 3/4 inch round, blue-green leaves are borne in 3s around the stems and each leaf is narrowly outlined in deep pink. During the hot summer months, this pink edge intensifies. In early fall, bright pink, star-shaped flowers are borne in small clusters at the ends of the stems.

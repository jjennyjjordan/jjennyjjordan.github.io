    Dwarf iris:
    <br>
    <br>
    Iris verna, dwarf iris, typically grows to about six inches tall. The violet colored flowers have the typical iris structure, comprised of three downward hanging sepals (called “falls”), and three relatively narrow and upright petals (called flags or banners). The blossoms of dwarf iris are fragrant. This plant flowers in early spring and is usually found in open, dry pine forests. Dwarf iris is most often found in small, often densely packed patches of a few to many plants.

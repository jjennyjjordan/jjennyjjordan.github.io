    Hibiscus syriacus 'Aphrodite' (rose-of-Sharon):
    <br>
    <br>
    Hibiscus syriacus, commonly called rose of Sharon or shrub althea, is a vigorous, upright, vase-shaped, multi-stemmed, deciduous shrub that typically grows 8-12’ tall. It may be trained as a small tree or espalier. Showy, hollyhock-like, 5-petaled flowers (to 3” diameter) appear over a long, early-summer to fall bloom period. Each flower has a prominent and showy center staminal column. Palmately-veined, coarsely-toothed, three-lobed, medium green leaves (to 4” long) are attractive during the growing season but produce no fall color.

    Artichoke flowers (Cynara scolymus ‘Opera’):
    <br>
    <br>
    Cynara cardunculus, commonly called cardoon, is a vigorous, columnar, upright, tender perennial that features prickly, razor-sharp, jagged, deeply-lobed, silver-gray leaves (white tomentose beneath) and thistle-like flowers. Although it is an edible vegetable (celery-like stalks may be blanched, harvested, steamed or braised and eaten), it is typically not grown in the U.S. for consumption as a vegetable, but is more often grown ornamentally in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers (flowers bloom August-September in cold winter climates). It typically grows in a clump to 3' tall from which rise flower stalks to 6' tall topped with thistle-like blue-violet flowers.
